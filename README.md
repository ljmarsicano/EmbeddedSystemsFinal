In this project, the implementation of a smart oven detection and display system is detailed. 
The detection system works with a combination of two separate temperature sensors, each of which represent and would be mounted to the burner of the oven, 
and the internal chamber of the oven, and a light sensor, which would be also in the main chamber. When rising above a certain temperature, the red LEDs 
will either flash or turn on, and if the oven door is not fully closed and some light is still filtering in, the green LED will turn off, indicating that 
the oven is not safe to leave. Additionally, the oven detection system communicates with an internet of things and transmits the current temperature inside 
the oven. This could be used to inform the owner of the oven what the temperature inside it could be for convenience or safety reasons. This system was implemented
using the prototype PCB board, and is fully soldered and functional.
